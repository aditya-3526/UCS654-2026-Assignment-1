# TOPSIS Assignment – Complete Implementation (CLI, PyPI Package & Web Service)

This repository contains a **complete end-to-end implementation of the TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution)** method, developed in three parts as per the assignment requirements.

The project includes:
- A **command-line Python program**
- A **Python package published on PyPI**
- A **web-based service with email delivery of results**

---

## 📌 What is TOPSIS?

TOPSIS is a **Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM)** technique used to rank alternatives based on their distance from:
- **Ideal Best Solution**
- **Ideal Worst Solution**

The best alternative is the one **closest to the ideal best** and **farthest from the ideal worst**.

---

# 🔹 PART–I: Command Line TOPSIS Program

## 📂 Description
In Part-I, TOPSIS is implemented as a **standalone Python command-line application**.  
The program accepts:
- Input data file (CSV/Excel)
- Weights
- Impacts
- Output file name

It validates inputs, performs TOPSIS computation, and outputs a ranked result file.

---

## ▶️ Usage

```bash
python topsis.py data.xlsx "1,1,1,1,2" "+,+,-,+,+" output.csv
```
## 🧠 Methodology

The TOPSIS methodology is implemented using the following sequential steps:

### 1. Decision Matrix Construction
- The first column of the input file represents the alternatives.
- All remaining columns represent criteria values and must be numeric.

### 2. Normalization of Decision Matrix
To remove scale differences between criteria, vector normalization is applied:
vij = rij × wj

where `wj` represents the weight of the *j-th* criterion.

### 4. Identification of Ideal Best and Ideal Worst
Based on the impacts provided:
- For **positive impact (+)** → maximum value is ideal best
- For **negative impact (-)** → minimum value is ideal best

The opposite values form the ideal worst solution.

### 5. Separation Measures
Euclidean distances are calculated for each alternative:

- Distance from ideal best (S⁺)
- Distance from ideal worst (S⁻)

### 6. TOPSIS Score Calculation
The relative closeness of each alternative to the ideal solution is computed as:
TOPSIS Score = S⁻ / (S⁺ + S⁻)


### 7. Ranking of Alternatives
Alternatives are ranked in descending order of TOPSIS scores.
- Higher score → better rank

## 📊 Result Table

The output file generated by the program includes:
- Original input data
- **TOPSIS Score**
- **Rank**

## 🔹 PART–II: Python Package (PyPI)

### 📦 Overview

In Part–II, the TOPSIS implementation is converted into a reusable **Python package** and published on **PyPI**.  
This allows users to install and execute the TOPSIS algorithm directly from the command line.

---

### 📥 Installation

pip install Topsis-Aditya-102303526


---

### ▶️ Execution After Installation

topsis data.xlsx "1,1,1,1,2" "+,+,-,+,+" result.csv


---

### ⚙️ Package Features

- Built using `setuptools`
- Command-line interface exposed using `console_scripts`
- Secure upload to PyPI using API token and 2FA
- Fully modular and reusable

## 🔹 PART–III: Web Service

### 🌐 Overview

In Part–III, a **Flask-based web service** is developed to provide TOPSIS as an online service.  
Users can upload input data, specify weights and impacts, and receive results via email.

---

### 🧩 Web Service Workflow

1. User uploads the input Excel file
2. User enters weights and impacts
3. User provides a valid email address
4. Server validates all inputs
5. TOPSIS computation is executed on the server
6. Result file is generated and emailed to the user

---

### 🖥️ Web Interface

---

### 📧 Email-Based Result Delivery

The system automatically sends:
- A CSV file containing TOPSIS scores and ranks
- Delivered as an email attachment to the user

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Flask
- Pandas
- NumPy
- SMTP (Email Service)
- HTML

---

## 📊 Result Interpretation

- Higher TOPSIS scores indicate better-performing alternatives
- The method ensures objective decision-making
- Both beneficial and non-beneficial criteria are considered simultaneously
